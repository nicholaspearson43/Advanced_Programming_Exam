## Directory: _c++_
### Content
The folder includes all the source files produced, a `Makefile` and a short `report` to explain the general structure of the implementation and the fuctions.
The file `node.hpp` includes the implementation of a struct Node, templated on the type of the key and that of the value stored in the node. The file `iterators.hpp` is the implementation of a class Iterator, templated on two typenames: the node type and the type of the element inserted in the node. Finally, the header `bst.hpp` includes the implementation of the bst class and all the public memeber functions that were requested. 
All the functions were tested in the `main.cpp`. 
The `report` presens more in detail the implementation.

### How to compile and run
Using the included `Makefile`, to compile the source files and run a sample program use
```bash
make
./main
```

## Directory: _python_
This directory contains the Jupyter notebook of the assigned exercise and its test file.
The ```reverse_dict``` function passed both tests.
